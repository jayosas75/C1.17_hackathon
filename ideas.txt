git serial killer wall - connect a bunch of different things with string to show useful related news, videos, music, etc? (spell with flickr!)

political app of some kind - showing amount of tweets by region or cross-referenced with polls or something?

deck of cards API -- some sort of online gambling game? not sure how to incorporate other APIs -- speech recognition for hit/stay?

<HACKATHON#2 IDEA - YAERI>

dinner party planner -- get recipes from bigoven, pair with songs from the same region (figure that out with the wiki API or something?), youtube videos, news or culture articles (talking points!)

event calendars pulling from meetup? stubhub?

blind date app - find people nearby (use location api) and use eventful to find fun stuff like concerts, and use yelp to find nearby restaurants with good ratings,
                 to figure out where to go on blind date, it'll be random so the two people get no choice, just preferences
this is not a dating app (aka Friend Zoned) - like the blind date app, but not for romance, just friends forever
music app - help people find out lyrics to their favorite songs, or find songs based on limited lyrics that they remember, soundcloud, lyricwiki, lyricsfly
